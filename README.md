> # TF2 Old Sandman Bonk v1.1
This plugin brings back ***Bonk!*** on Sandman (so before Jungle Inferno Update) on TF2.
I reworked it so _it's slightly_ more optimized now, *and* easier to maintain.

> ## Installation
#### How to install ?
+ Use `git clone https://github.com/walgrim-dev/TF2-Old-Sandman-Bonk.git`
+ Install the `bonk.smx` into your `addons/sourcemod/plugins/` folder !
+ You're good to go !

### The source was compiled using `sourcemod-1.9.0-git6282` and ran on a server using `mmsource-1.11.0-git1148` and `sourcemod-1.11.0-git6934`.
